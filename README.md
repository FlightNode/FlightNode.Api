# FlightNode.DataCollection
API for bird monitoring and volunteer data collection. See http://flightnode.gifthub.io for more information.

Until the dependencies are more stable, the solution for FlightNode.DataCollection will have direct references to projects in other repositories. Create a common base directory (e.g. `c:\workspaces\FlightNode`) and clone all FlightNode projects into that same parent.

One implication is that Visual Studio will not be adequate for managing Git check-ins, as it does not support having one solution with multiple projects in it. It is recommended that you use the bash prompt instead and the powerful Git commandline. It can be simplest to open a separate bash prompt for each repository directory while in active development.
